# Covid-19 Screening Policy Evaluation in Small Populations

**Work In Progress!**

We use the Julia package https://github.com/kkmann/cov19sim to simulate the effect of several possible screening policies 
that were discussed in the context of school reopening in the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The latest results are pushed to the gh-pages branch.
