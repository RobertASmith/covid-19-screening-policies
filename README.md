# Covid-19 Screening Policy Evaluation in Small Populations

**Work In Progress!**

We use the Julia package [https://github.com/kkmann/cov19sim] to simulate the effect of several possible screening policies 
that were discussed in the context of school reopening in the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The latest results can be found on the project's [gh-pages site](https://kkmann.github.io/covid-19-screening-policies/).
